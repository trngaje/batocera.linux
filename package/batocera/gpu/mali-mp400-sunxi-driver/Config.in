	  This package builds and installs the Linux kernel driver for
	  the Mali Utgard GPU on Allwinner platforms, compatible with
	  the legacy Linux kernel (3.4). Note that it should be
	  installed together with the corresponding userspace OpenGL
	  libraries, which are provided as binaries only at:
